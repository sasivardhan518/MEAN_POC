            <h1>Advantages</h1>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>There are many time tracking software benefits including better task management. There are so many little tasks involved in any business, and often, most of us donâ€™t even realize just how many tasks are being managed at once. Time tracking software ensures that nothing is ever missed, and that everything gets done when it should.</p>
                <h3>Better Focus</h3>
                <p>One of the great things about employees being able to track their own time is that they really get to see the whole picture of how productive they actually are. When they see areas where productivity is lower than others, they are able to focus better on their work. They will know how much time they are spending on each task, if they are running behind, and how they can better allot their time to be more productive. They can also inform managers that some projects may be a bit late so the project deadline can be extended.</p>
                <h3>Better Workflow</h3>
                <p>When you have time management software, you are better able to understand everything that is going on within a business. It gives business owners a great overview of the entire business, how employees are spending their time, and more. This is helpful when it comes to streamlining things, rearranging projects, assigning tasks, etc.</p>
